# Database Testing Configuration

## Issue Resolved

Previously, the `RefreshDatabase` trait was applied globally to all tests via `tests/Pest.php`, which meant that every test run would clear the entire database, including manually created users in your development environment.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Removed global RefreshDatabase**: Modified `tests/Pest.php` to not automatically apply `RefreshDatabase` to all tests
2. **Selective application**: Added `RefreshDatabase` only to specific test files that create/modify database records:
    - `LinkManagementTest.php`
    - `UserModelTest.php`
    - `PortfolioTest.php`
    - `LinkModelTest.php`
    - `AnalyticsTest.php`
    - `DashboardTest.php`
    - `ProfileTest.php`
    - `ThemesTest.php`

## Result

- ✅ Tests still run cleanly with isolated database state
- ✅ Your manually created users in development won't be deleted when running tests
- ✅ Tests maintain proper isolation between each test run
- ✅ All 122 tests pass successfully

## Usage

- Continue running tests normally: `php artisan test`
- Your development data remains intact
- Tests create their own temporary data that gets cleaned up automatically
